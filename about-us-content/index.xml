      <description>Church leaders of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP), Bradford Church, organized and established the Matilda L. Bradford Christian School, Inc. (MLBCSI) on February 11,1996.
The MLBCSI was founded to continue, enhance and actualize the Christian Education Nurture – Children’s Ministry (CEN) of the church.
The objectives of the CEN include “the creation of a teaching and learning environment that nurtures faith, builds communities and enhances the response of people to God’s call to mission; and the strengthening of the faith journey of the members of the congregation that they may realize, experience and live a life acceptable to God”.</description>
